	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01878},
	abstract = {Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network’s various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015a; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model’s dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efﬁcient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we ﬁnd large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.},

We provide a meta-analysis of the literature, including an overview of approaches to pruning and consistent ﬁndings in the literature. After aggregating results across 81 papers and pruning hundreds of models in controlled conditions, our clearest ﬁnding is that the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This deﬁciency is substantial enough that it is hard to compare pruning techniques to one another or determine how much progress the ﬁeld has made over the past three decades. To address this situation, we identify issues with current practices, suggest concrete remedies, and introduce ShrinkBench, an open-source framework to facilitate standardized evaluations of pruning methods. We use ShrinkBench to compare various pruning techniques and show that its comprehensive evaluation can prevent common pitfalls when comparing pruning methods.},

We propose a novel method that estimates the contribution of a neuron (ﬁlter) to the ﬁnal loss and iteratively removes those with smaller scores. We describe two variations of our method using the ﬁrst and secondorder Taylor expansions to approximate a ﬁlter’s contribution. Both methods scale consistently across any network layer without requiring per-layer sensitivity analysis and can be applied to any kind of layer, including skip connections. For modern networks trained on ImageNet, we measured experimentally a high ({\textgreater}93\%) correlation between the contribution computed by our methods and a reliable estimate of the true importance. Pruning with the proposed methods leads to an improvement over state-ofthe-art in terms of accuracy, FLOPs, and parameter reduction. On ResNet-101, we achieve a 40\% FLOPS reduction by removing 30\% of the parameters, with a loss of 0.02\% in the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

We propose a method using sequential randomization of input parameters to determine the relative proportion to which each input variable contributes to the predictive ability of the ANN model (termed the holdback input randomization method or HIPR method). Validity of the method was assessed using a simulated data set in which the relationship between input parameters and output parameters were completely known. Simulated data sets were generated with known linear, nonlinear, and collinear relationships. The HIPR method was performed repetitively on ANN models trained on these data sets. The method was successful in predicting rank order of importance on all data sets, performing as well as or better than the recently proposed connectivity weight method. One main advantage of using this method relative to others is that results can be obtained without making assumptions regarding the architecture of the ANN model used. These results also serve to illustrate the consistency and information content of ANN models in general, and highlight their potential use in exploring ecological relationships.

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful tools for data analysis and are particularly suitable for modeling relationships between variables for best prediction of an outcome. While these models can be used to answer many important research questions, their utility has been critically limited because the interpretation of the “black box” model is difficult. Clinical investigators usually employ ANN models to predict the clinical outcomes or to make a diagnosis; the model however is difficult to interpret for clinicians. To address this important shortcoming of neural network modeling methods, we describe several methods to help subject-matter audiences (e.g., clinicians, medical policy makers) understand neural network models. Garson’s algorithm describes the relative magnitude of the importance of a descriptor (predictor) in its connection with outcome variables by dissecting the model weights. The Lek’s profile method explores the relationship of the outcome variable and a predictor of interest, while holding other predictors at constant values (e.g., minimum, 20th quartile, maximum). While Lek’s profile was developed specifically for neural networks, partial dependence plot is a more generic version that visualize the relationship between an outcome and one or two predictors. Finally, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method can show the predictions of any classification or regression, by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. R code for the implementations of these methods is shown by using example data fitted with a standard, feed-forward neural network model. We offer codes and step-by-step description on how to use these tools to facilitate better understanding of ANN.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful tools that are used in various engineering fields. Their characteristics enable them to solve prediction, regression, and classification problems. Nevertheless, the ANN is usually thought of as a black box, in which it is difficult to determine the effect of each explicative variable (input) on the dependent variables (outputs) in any problem. To investigate such effects, sensitivity analysis is usually applied on the optimal pre-trained ANN. Existing sensitivity analysis techniques suffer from drawbacks. Their basis on a single optimal pre-trained ANN model produces instability in parameter sensitivity analysis because of the uncertainty in neural network modeling. To overcome this deficiency, two successful sensitivity analysis paradigms, the neural network committee (NNC)-based sensitivity analysis and the neural network ensemble (NNE)-based parameter sensitivity analysis, are illustrated in this chapter. An NNC is applied in a case study of geotechnical engineering involving strata movement. An NNE is implemented for sensitivity analysis of two classic problems in civil engineering: (i) the fracture failure of notched concrete beams and (ii) the lateral deformation of deep-foundation pits. Results demonstrate good ability to analyze the sensitivity of the most influential parameters, illustrating the underlying mechanisms of such engineering systems.},

Functions in the package can be used to obtain the sensitivities of the output with respect to the input variables, evaluate variable importance based on sensitivity measures and characterize relationships between input and output variables. Methods to calculate sensitivities are provided for objects from common neural network packages in R, including neuralnet, nnet, RSNNS, h2o, neural, forecast and caret.

	abstract = {Despite their successes in the field of self-learning AI, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) suffer from having too many trainable parameters, impacting computational performance. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the number of parameters in the visual domain, the Inception architecture [Szegedy et al., 2016] being a prominent example. This raises the question whether the number of trainable parameters in CNNs can also be reduced for 1D inputs, such as time-series data, without incurring a substantial loss in classification performance. We propose and examine two methods for complexity reduction in AstroNet [Shallue \& Vanderburg, 2018], a CNN for automatic classification of time-varying brightness data of stars to detect exoplanets. The first method makes only a tactical reduction of layers in AstroNet while the second method also modifies the original input data by means of a Gaussian pyramid. We conducted our experiments with various degrees of dropout regularization. Our results show only a nonsubstantial loss in accuracy compared to the original AstroNet, while reducing training time up to 85 percent. These results show potential for similar reductions in other CNN applications while largely retaining accuracy.},

The contributions of this special issue cover a wide range of aspects of such problems: providing a better deﬁnition of the objective function, feature construction, feature ranking, multivariate feature selection, efﬁcient search methods, and feature validity assessment methods.},

	abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difﬁcult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks ﬁx the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to ﬁne tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9×, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the total number of parameters can be reduced by 13×, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Optical communication systems are facing the challenge to become robust to dynamic operating conditions, thus requiring autonomous devices. Optical ampliﬁers are essential devices for establishing optical communication systems with good quality of transmission. However, optical ampliﬁers include noise and present a non-ﬂat spectral response. As a consequence, simple regression methods are not suitable for modeling ampliﬁer response. The ampliﬁer output signal estimation has been studied in other works. However, all the previous works only use characterization data with a ﬂat input signal power spectrum, which can decrease the accuracy of the previous estimators when the ampliﬁers are under real-world conditions. In this work, we proposed models based on an artiﬁcial neural network to estimate the optical ampliﬁer output signal considering characterization data with non-ﬂat signals. The results show that the previous models, proposed for ﬂat characterization, do not perform well with non-ﬂat data. The results obtained by the new models are promising since they returned a smaller estimation error than the previous models. We observed an error reduction of 4 dB when compared with the previous models under certain circumstances. Moreover, the proposed models are robust even when we use limited non-ﬂat data in the training process.},

The goal is to smoothly adjust the gain of each amplifier in the cascade in order to reach predefined input and output power levels for the entire link, aiming to minimize both the noise figure and the gain flatness of the transmission system. The proposal uses an iterative method and performs feedforward and backward error adjustments based on local information. The experimental results indicate that our proposal can optimize the performance of the link ensuring predefined input and output power levels, which is important in a network scenario. As an example, our proposal was capable to define the gain of 6 amplifiers returning a link with a noise figure equal to 30.06 dB and a gain flatness equal to 5.26 dB, while maintaing the input and output powers around 3 dBm with an error lower than 0.1 dB.},

We demonstrate that channel addition causes much faster transients than channel dropping in wavelength division multiplexing networks.

The analytic expressions presented, which involve the solution of one transcendental equation, can predict signal gains and pump absorptions in an amplifier containing an arbitrary number of pumps and signals from arbitrary directions. The gain of an amplifier was measured over a range of more than 20 dB in both pump and signal powers. The measured theoretical results agreed to within 0.5 dB. Although the results described apply explicitly to EDFAs pumped in the 1480-nm region, they are also applicable to EDFAs pumped in the 980-nm region. The method is valid whenever the gain saturation by amplified spontaneous-emission noise can be neglected, which is typically the case for amplifiers with less than about 20 dB of gain.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The benefits of adopting optical burst switching (OBS) in optical networks as well as the technological issues of the optical layer have been extensively studied. One of the challenges in developing commercial OBS systems is the use of the Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) technology to amplify bursty optical signals. A significant impairment in EDFA-based OBS systems is caused by the Spectral Hole Burning (SHB) of the EDFA. Due to this effect, the presence of a channel at a given wavelength induces a localised reduction in the EDFA gain spectrum that is a few nm wide (“a spectral hole”). An optical burst crossing an EDFA will require a certain amount of time to induce a hole in the gain spectrum; during this time the burst itself will therefore experience a variable gain. Under particular traffic conditions, this effect accumulates over a cascade of EDFAs resulting in large power excursions of the burst. In this paper the authors characterize the dynamics of SHB in OBS systems and describe its effect on the optical performance.},

The change has already begun: simple on-off modulation of signals, which was adequate for bit rates up to 10 Gb/s, has given way to much more sophisticated modulation schemes for 100 Gb/s and beyond. The next bottleneck is the 10-year-old division of the optical spectrum into a fixed “wavelength grid,” which will no longer work for 400 Gb/s and above, heralding the need for a more flexible grid. Once both transceivers and switches become flexible, a whole new elastic optical networking paradigm is born.
